Place data here:
1. A model in sbml format (we used RECON1 from BiGG).
2. A gene expression file in csv format, samples over genes (we used CCLE GE data).
3. An exchange flux file in csv format, samples over reactions (we used NCI60 fluxes sourced from Jain et. al., 2012, Metabolite profiling identifies a key role for glycine in rapid cancer cell proliferation).
4. An intracellular flux file in csv format, samples over reactions (we used the ones sources from Zielinski et. al., 2017, Systems biology analysis of drivers underlying hallmarks of cancer cell metabolism).
